# Metronome-App Android [In Progress]
A minimalist metronome designed for android.\
***The app is not yet available on the Play Store**

## Presentation of the project
The goal was to offer a metronome that I would like to have as a musician: intuitive and easy to use (I kept only the most important functionality), light weigth, and finally without ads !!

## The design
The design was thinking around the idea of having a large area on the screen for selecting the tempo, so a big part of the screen is used to select the tempo by scrolling. Many version was made on **Figma** to find a good look and an intuitive design for me.
